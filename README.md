ATTRACTOR_0.py script is used for calculating the attractors of the network where no silencing intervention has been performed on any gene of the system.

With the ATTRACTOR_1.py script it is possible to calculate the attractors of the network with the VIM, HSP90AB1, TK1, CSNK2B and YWHAB genes constantly silenced. 

With ATTRACTOR_2.py script it is possible to calculate the boolean attractors of the network with the genes STAT5A, HIF1A and BRCA1 constantly silenced. 

The boolean values to be used in the various scripts can be found in the excel file "Supplementary_Table S2" in the corresponding sheets. 

The use of python version 2.7 is recommended.

The CCDF.py script produces figure 6 of the report by processing the Adjacency_list.csv file. 

In "Supplementary Table 1.xlsx"  the specific functions of activation or inhibition of the group of genes used for detecting the process of apoptosis are specified.
